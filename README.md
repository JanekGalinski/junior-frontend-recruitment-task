# junior-frontend-recruitment-task

Hey there!

Thank you for joining recruitment process for Junior Front-end Dev at Performante. We have a small task for you, that covers all topics which you'll be able to touch in our common journey ðŸš€

[Last.fm](https://www.last.fm/) is a well-known website which allows you to manage your music preferences.

**We would like to know which 20 artists are currently the most popular in Poland and all around the World.**

Your task is to create a website which allows us to check this.

The website should look like this:

Project goals:

* Implement the website according to the [design](https://www.figma.com/file/3o9ia7vUV89deFesxn2wFh/Recruitment-Landing-Page-Junior-Frontend-Test?node-id=0%3A1)

* User can select between global and Polish top charts

* Top 5 artists are visible as a carousel

* Another 15 artists should be visible as a card

* User should be able to rate the artists (votes don't have to be saved, we only want to see how it will be visible for the users)

---

Basic rules:
* All JS Frameworks allowed, but you don't have to use them. Just inform us how to run the website if you're using a framework ;)

* For a purpose of this task, you should fork this repository (pushing changes to this repository is not allowed)

* You should create an account in last.fm to get access to [Last.fm API](https://www.last.fm/api)

* Pay attention to code quality, formatting, conventions etc.

* Remember about users with retina screens and mobile devices

**Good luck! If you have any questions feel free to ask!**
